# Horiseon Website Refactoring

## Description

The goal in refactoring Horiseon's website was to make it more accessible and user friendly. The website started with a strong foundation to work from; this allowed me to learn the value of having HTML and CSS elements located properly and how this organization plays a part in a website functioning correctly.

Using my knowledge of HTML semantic elements and CSS labeling best practices, I was able to touch up the site ensuring it's seamless functionality and eye catching design.
