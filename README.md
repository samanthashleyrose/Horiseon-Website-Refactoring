# Horiseon Website Refactoring

## Description

The goal in refactoring Horiseon's website was to make it more accessible and user friendly. The website started with a strong foundation to work from; this allowed me to learn the value of having HTML and CSS elements located properly and how this organization plays a part in a website functioning correctly.

Using my knowledge of HTML semantic elements and CSS labeling best practices, I was able to touch up the site ensuring it's seamless functionality and eye catching design.

## Usage

When opening the site you may begin by using the Navigation Links at the top of the page to bring you to your desired topic. In addition, alt image tags are attached to each image for accessibility to all users. <a href="https://samanthashleyrose.github.io/module01-challenge/">View Horiseon Company Skills and Strategies Website</a>

The suggested viewing ratio is between 1012 x 790 (min) and 1437 x 790 (max) to avoid distortion of text.
